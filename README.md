# Perceptron Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project is a simple implementation of the **Perceptron algorithm** from scratch (without scikit-learn).  
It trains a binary classifier on the **Iris dataset** to distinguish between *Iris-setosa* and *Iris-versicolor*.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Custom `Perceptron` class (no external ML libraries used).
- Training loop with weight updates using perceptron learning rule.
- Visualization of:
  - Training errors across epochs.
  - Decision boundaries in feature space.
- Clean implementation for learning basics of machine learning.

## ðŸš€ Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib
